            <p>...and this is my cover-letter for Sendible's Junior Software Tester position </p>

                <h1>Why you want to work in Sendible’s QA Team?</h1>
                <p>I decided to apply for the role of software tester, as after spending my last few years in Digital Marketing field, I realised that it’s actually problem-solving and technical side of the role that I like more. I enjoy troubleshooting, testing and implementing new features more than researching keywords and optimising content so Google likes it a bit more.</p>
                <h1>Why you want to work at Sendible and not somewhere else.</h1>
                <p>I want to work at Sendible specifically, because I believe that being a part of something big, and delivering a quality product, is what matters most in the end of the day, and it’s what makes your workplace a place worth waking up for every morning.</p>

                <p>I believe I’m a good candidate for this position as I have experience working with various social media apps and reporting bugs to in-house developer team and external support.</p>

                <h1>A description of a great user experience you had recently, and what made it great?</h1>
                <p>When it comes to a great user experience I recently had, I’d choose Gram Multitool 2. After spending years using FollowLiker, I greeted features like clear separation of tasks (here called ‘modules’) and Analytics with open arms. Another feature I enjoyed was a clean and informative “Summary” section, containing logs of all processed actions and errors. </p>

                <h1>A time you taught yourself a new skill to complete a job or project.</h1>
                <p>I really enjoy learning new things - my latest professional challenge was to learn Linnworks software inside out - starting from creating and managing listings and ending with order processing. Another example of learning a new skill to complete a project could be this cover-letter-style website I created.</p>

                <h1>What is Sendible's mission?</h1>
                <p>Sendible’s mission is to help brands (or agencies on their behalf) build a strong community, deliver engaging content and convey the right messages at the right time.</p>
                <h1>What is Sendible's top feature request right now and why is it important to our users?</h1>
                <p>Current top feature request is adding locations to instagram posts. It is extremely important to users as it’s an additional way of getting traffic. Lots of instagram users browse Instagram  not only using hashtags, but also locations.</p>

                <h1>What's the difference between queues and regular scheduling within Sendible?</h1>
                <p>Regular scheduling allows to post content on a specific time and date. It also gives you more time to spot errors in the content before publishing. However, in the long run it may not be the most time-efficient way to manage content, especially with a huge amount of posts to be published.</p>                
                <p>Queues on the other hand, might not be the best choice for posts that need to be published on specific time and date. Queues require more setting-up time up front, but save time in the long run. In addition, posts published using queues feature look more organic (posting at 20:19 looks more authentic than 20:00).</p>
